## About

Hi, I'm **uzqw** - a software engineer passionate about deep-diving into technical challenges and sharing practical knowledge from real-world engineering experiences.

You can find me on GitHub: [@uzqw](https://github.com/uzqw)

## Intent

This repository serves as my **blog laboratory** - a collection of technical articles, experiments, and investigations that document my journey through various software engineering topics. Each folder contains a standalone article or experiment, covering areas like:

- **Performance Engineering**: Investigating and solving real-world performance bottlenecks
- **Concurrency Patterns**: Deep-diving into locks, synchronization, and parallel programming
- **Systems Programming**: Exploring low-level concepts and optimization techniques
- **Best Practices**: Documenting lessons learned from production systems

## Philosophy

My approach to technical writing:

- **Start with Real Problems**: Every article originates from actual production issues or genuine curiosity
- **Go Beyond Surface Level**: Don't just show "how" - explain "why" with data and benchmarks
- **Show Your Work**: Include profiling results, benchmark comparisons, and debugging processes
- **Practical Over Theoretical**: Focus on actionable insights that engineers can apply immediately

## Repository Structure

Each folder follows the naming convention `YYMMDD-topic-name` and contains:
- Supporting code, benchmarks, or examples as needed

## Contact

Feel free to reach out or open issues if you have questions, suggestions, or want to discuss any of the topics covered here.
